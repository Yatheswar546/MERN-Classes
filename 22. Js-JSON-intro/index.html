    <h1>JSON - JavaScript Object Notation</h1>
    
    <!-- 
        JSON is basically a text format that makes it easy to share data between Clients and Servers. 
        
        It is a lightweight format for strings and transporting data from a server to webpage, it is "self-describing" 
        and easy to understand.
        
        It is widely used across many Languages like C, Ruby, Python, PHP etc....

        ==> We use JSON for such situations in which data is passed in an array of objects.

        Eg:
        Object
        var mObj = {
            "name": "Yatheswar",
            "age": 24
        }

        console.log(mObj.age);

        Array
        var mArr = [1,2,3,4,5]
        console.log(mArr[0]);

        JSON
        var mJson = [
            {
                "name": "Yatheswar",
                "age": 24
            },
            {
                "name": "Harsha",
                "age": 21
            },
            {
                "name": "Akash",
                "age": 21
            }
        ]

        ==> JSON doesn't hold undefined, functions and date it's just simply ignore them.

        var mJson = [
            {
                "name": "Yatheswar",
                "age": 24,
                "lastName": undefined
            },
            {
                "name": "Harsha",
                "age": 21,
                "getName": function(){
                    return this.name
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Akash",
                "age": 21
            }
        ]

        ==> JSON accepts string, number, object, array, boolean, null

        var mJson = [
            {
                "name": "Yatheswar",
                "age": 24,
                "marriage": false
            },
            {
                "name": "Harsha",
                "age": 21,
                score: [87, 90, 75 87],
                "bike": null
            },
            {
                "name": "Akash",
                "age": 21,
                score: {
                    "C": 87,
                    "Java": 78,
                    "M1": 88
                }
            }
        ]

        JSON.parse(): JSON(string) ===> JSON(object)
            The data received from server will be in string format so we need to parse to get object.

        JSON.stringify(): JSON(object) ===> JSON(string)
            The data should be send in string format to server.

        USES:
        ==> Less verbose - uses fewer characters and tags to represent same data.
        ==> Faster
        ==> Readable
        ==> Objects align in code
        ==> Structured in easier way

        Why JSON is better:
        ==> It doesn't use end tag.
        ==> It is shorter
        ==> Quicker to read and write.
        ==> JSON can use arrays.
        ==> XML has to be parsed with an XML parser. JSON can be parsed by JSON.parse().
        ==> For AJAX applications, JSON is faster and easier.
        ==> Whenever we want to get data from server it will be difficult to fetch data in a "plain text" (or) "XML" format
            because data would be bulky and cause too much overhead for web services.
