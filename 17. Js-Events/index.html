    <h1>Js Events & Event Handlers</h1>

    <!-- 
        Events:
        HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML Elements.
        When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

        An HTML event can be something the browser does or something a user does

        Here are some examples of HTML Events:
        -> An HTML web page has finished loading
        -> An HTML input field was changed
        -> An HTML button was clicked
        -> Pressing a key
        -> Clicking the mouse
        -> Form submission
        -> Video controls

        List of HTML Events:
        onchange        ->  An HTML element has been changed
        onclick         ->  The user clicks an HTML element
        onmouseover     ->  The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
        onmouseout      ->  The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
        onkeydown       ->  The user pushes a keyboard key
        onload          ->  The browser has finished loading the page
    -->

    <!-- 
        Event Handlers:
        Event Handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions and browser actions:
        ->  Things that should be done every time a page loads
        ->  Things that should be done when the page is closed
        ->  Actions that should be performed when a user clicks a button
        ->  Content that should be verified when a user inputs data.
        ->  And more.........


        Two Ways of Event Handling:
        1) Event Properties:
           selectedElement.eventProperty = function() {}

        2) addEventListener()
            selectedElement.addEventListener(eventName, function(){ } )
